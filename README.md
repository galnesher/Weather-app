## General info
The 'WeatherApp' is a web application that demonstrates a weather forecast website.
For the client-side I used 'React', the data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap API.

### Flow
1. The user views the React web app with a browser.
2. The React front end communicates with OpenWeatherMap API.
7. Front-end results are rendered in a human readable format to the user.
